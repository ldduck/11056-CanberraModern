## Project 1: Responsive Website

### Successes

- The Website is simple in in design, making navigation easy and information cleanly presented. With adjustments the website could easily utilise a minimalist style.
- I'm proud of the fact I learned and accomplished this much with HTML and CSS in functionally 2.5 weeks, despite not learning the pre-requisite work in UCC's pre-requisite class.
- Solid commenting on the styles.css file, including good grouping for classes/ids/other styling components.

### Improvements

- Further exploration with styling the website would dramatically improve the general "vibe". Due to the time period's history with utilitarian and brutalist architecture, an equially minimalist/retro aesthetic would fit well in my opinion.
- Due to external circumstances impacting the productivity in the early to middle stages of the project, the whole process was quite rushed. Having more time to optimise, clean and experiment with HTML & CSS would have drastically improved the overall quality.
- The website is functioning at the bare minimum. It's missing some key pages and information that would help Canberra Modern's cause.
- As this was also a learning exercise in the basics, plenty had to be rewritten or reformatted as new information was learned, resulting in wasted time in terms of completed assignment work.

### Prototype Implementation

- The idea of a landing page successfully made it into the website, as well as having a grid gallery. However the grid gallery changed from: A fully coloured image to catch the eye when hovered over, shows the title and key information related to the image while blurring the background. Unfortuately I could not get this to work without blurring the entire container. As a result, the opacity is reduced until the user hovers over the image, presenting the title and key information of the image.
- As mentioned briefly, the About, Events, and Resources pages are all critical to Canberra Modern's cause. Unfortunately they were not included due to time constraints. However, the About page was similar to the original website, however with the replacement of circle containers with box containers for images, this is to continue with the general theme across all pages. In addition, hiding the large blocks of detail text until the user hovers over them or clicks a "show more" button cleans up the pages significantly, contributing to a minimalist feel.
- The Events page would be similar to the Gallery page, however it shows current and future event information instead of past and current.
- The resources page consisted of the information from the Articles, Videos, Links and Partners pages. These would presented in large gallery segments that hide unwanted segments but shows you the segment you want. Frankly, I don't know how I was going to do this but it looked interesting and futher accentuates the focus on hiding unnecessary information.
